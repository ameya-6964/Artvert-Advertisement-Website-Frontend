        <h4>How It Will Benefit You üìà</h4>
        <div className="answer">
          <p>
            The goal of advertising is to capture attention. Running a
            successful campaign begins with posting something that people
            can&apos;t help but glance at. And you can tell you have a winner
            when an advertisement resembles a work of art rather than a giant
            &quot;buy me&quot; sign.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mural Advertising Appeals To So Many Advertisers Because Of This. It
            Provides A Means Of Artistically And Strikingly Encapsulating The
            Spirit Of The Brand. Due Of Their Ability To Go Viral, These Painted
            Advertisements Can Be Just As Successful As Billboards, If Not More
            So.

            Monthly Billboard Fees.
